	What time you coming out?<br>
We started losing light<br>
I'll never make it right<br>
If you don't want me 'round<br>
I'm so excited for the night<br>
All we need's my bike and your enormous house<br>
You said some day we might<br>
When I'm closer to your height<br>
'Til then we'll knock around and see<br>
If you're all I need<br>
Don't you see me now?<br>
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you<br>
Don't you need me?<br>
I, I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you<br>
And on this night and in this light<br>
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you<br>
Maybe you'll change your mind<br>
I'm caught on your coat again<br>
You said "Oh, no, it's fine"<br>
I read between the lines<br>
And touched your leg again, again<br>
I'll take you one day at a time<br>
Soon you will be mine<br>
Oh, but I want you now<br>
(I want you now)<br>
When the smoke is in your eyes<br>
You look so alive<br>
Do you fancy sitting down with me?<br>
'Cause you're all I need<br>
According to your heart<br>
My place is not deliberate<br>
Feeling of your arms<br>
I don't wanna be your friend<br>
I wanna kiss your neck<br>
Don't you see me?<br>
I, I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you<br>
Don't you need me?<br>
I, I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you<br>
And on this night and in this light<br>
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you<br>
Maybe you'll change your mind
